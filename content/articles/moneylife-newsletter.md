For a while now, I have been wanting to invest in stock market, but have been overwhelmed by sheer number of options to choose from. 

And investing money in here is now a necessity, as india is a developing economy and has seen huge number of multibaggers to date. And I don't want to miss these opportunities to invest and create wealth.

Hence I decided to shell out some money for this service. And If am able to make profit of around 16k every year on every 50k, buying this service will be worth it.

And people still are afraid of stock market, they say that it is a very dangerous thing. But only thing that is dangerous about it is volatility and it can be handled, by staying long.

So few days ago, I finally made the switch from [Google Passwords] to [Dashlane]. Why? Because giving the task to a master is always better than having it done by a jack of all trades. Although, it does leave a little hole in pocket. But it is worth the peace of mind.

And [google password] & [browser] stores the password just plainly somewhere, that dashlane was able to import it easily without any extra permissions. Migrating from Google Passwords to Dashlane was easy too. It only took 10 to 15 minutes of my time. 

For migration, I went to [Google Passwords] site and logged into my account. Clicked on setting button and selected the export password option. It gave me a .csv file. Which I imported into my Dashlane account via [Dashlane Chrome Extension] and then I was good to go. And also when I installed the Dashlane app on my android device, dashlane itself asked for importing all the saved passwords in chrome, to which I said - Yes, Please!.

Now to wipe the passwords from google servers and my google accounts, I followed the steps mentioned in this [link].

Also Dashlane gave me a VPN to use, all in same plan. But can't use that VPN on laptop, for now, it only works on android. Once I start my job in january, I will buy a VPN plan that will work cross platform.

<ul>
                <li>Space is 3 dimensional, having length breadth & height.</li>
                <li>When time is added as a fourth dimension, then that space is called space-time. So instead of saying 4D & 3D, we say space-time & space.</li>
                <li>Normally, we define a object using 3 three dimensions physically, but physical state change after some time. People then started using time as another quantity to define a physical state object.</li>
                <li>Gravity is defined as effect that curvature of space time have on mass, by Einstein.</li>
                <li>It is visualised in a simpler form using a trampoline or mat that space-time is the thread & time is the tension on the thread.</li>
                <li>When an object is kept on a trampoline it is dented, that is the gravity that other object in its vicinity experience.</li>
                <li>When two black holes collides it sends a ripple through the space time fabric known as gravitational waves.</li>
                <li>The ripple is the stretching and compressing of the space time.</li>
            </ul>

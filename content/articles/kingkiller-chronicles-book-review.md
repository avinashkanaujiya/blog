title: The King KIller Chronicles Series Review
publish: true
---

Read this incomplete series a while ago, didn't write a review then, but this book series is so good. It would be a shame not to write about it. I don't remember much but still remember the feeling that I had while reading the book. It was a peaceful feeling, certainly not associated with thriller fiction books. 

But it was so huge, one of the book is 900+ pages. Still really nice to read. The characters development is amazing. You will not even for a second think about skipping ahead to know what happens in the end. Way the characters are introduced is mind blowing. He makes you feel for kvothe. The harships he faced. The losses he endured. The love he found. Betrayals he saw. Never read any book series like it.

The author does not seem to be in a mood to publish the last book of the series. I am dying to know what happens at the end.

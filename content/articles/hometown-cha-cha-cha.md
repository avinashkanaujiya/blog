A korean show. And like all korean show it is also very pretty to look at. I don't know why everyone is so good looking in korean shows, I guess the pop culture loves it. Which hints to me that korean culture is pretty biased towards pretty people(see what I did here). And I hate those culture. But we are not here to talk or write about it.

This show is pretty, as I already mentioned. It has some good story, but not very unique. It's okay for passing time, if you don't have anything to watch.

And it is so boring that I honestly can't write more about it.

Consciousness pollutes things.

Humans are conscious beings. Look how they have polluted the nature. They are not even satisfied by it, they are even more miserable than ever before.

Similar analogy applies to everyday things that we do. More we try to achieve something, the more it gets away from us. How crazy right?. How could this be correct?. You would say, in school or such environment we routinely set targets and achieve it, right?. When I say, we do achieve things but miss out on the process or journey of it, many of you would agree. 

When we are running behind a goal or desire, we aim to do an efficient job, hence we abandon anything that might lead us away, in short term, from goal. In reality, those things might be the one that forge your path towards your goal. Definitely true for broader or more general goals in life.

History is filled with discoveries/inventions, which were not intended consequences of the inventor/discoverer's actions.

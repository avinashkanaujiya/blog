Hello guys,

This article will not have any meaningful impact on you or your life, but its cool to read and may be helpful. Also, I had no idea what to write about, hence this.

Whenever I have to find a word for a username for any website ( read it as social media sites/ games/ name of the blog(smiley)), I have a real crisis. I feel I have to find that super cool name, so when I become recognized or something, people will love it and not make fun of it. (I am talking about you memers, and YES, I am that sensitive). I know. I know. Getting recognized is like 1 in a billion shot for an extreme introvert like me (If you didn’t know before, YES, I am an Introvert, and I also like to write things in brackets). But still, having high hope is a good thing, and it never hurts to be ready. (Smiley)

Today I was struggling with finding a better name for the blog; I wanted the name to have some class at the same time it should have been an acronym ( because original and useful acronyms are so much fresh and mysteries just like an introvert ). So I went along and tried to find some cool names with abbreviations, but I couldn’t come up with anything, whatever I came up with were so dull and plain dull, but then I had an idea of just listing out every topic that my blog might have in future and then started putting them in 4 broad categories - **l**ogs, **o**pinions, **n**otes, **r**esearch and many more. But then something crazy happened. As I was looking at the list I someone realized that the first letter of words was making some relatable words in the form of Acronyms - LONR, and I loved it instantly, and also being an introvert, it suits me and my blog - Loner - a lonely guy.

At the same time, I realized that I have stumbled upon something good. Then I started to formalize what I did above (of course, I did - for the sake of having an article to publish).

*   List everything about the thing (say attributes or quality or its function) you are trying to name, don’t make it longer than 6 to 10.
*   Then make a 4 to 6-word combination of initials of each word. You can also use an online tool for that matter.
*   Then go through each of them and see if acronyms are making any sense.
*   When it does. Voila!. You have your cool acronym.

But sometimes cool acronyms never show up, so you have to change the list of words. And then do the same steps again.

And as I was doing all this formalizing, I realized just like me somebody else might have realized this too. And could have done some extensive research on it. So I set upon finding it.

What I found was not exactly what I hoped for, but it was close enough.

Just as any research starts with going back to basics, let’s just do that.

Along with acronyms, you might have heard about Abbreviations. So what is it? An Abbreviation is any shortened word or phrase like St. in Saint or Rx for prescription and such. As it is evident from examples, an abbreviation can be created using any letters to represent a word (look at Rx for a prescription - it has no commonality in between them).

Abbreviations are further split into acronyms and initialisms. Although initialism is fading as acronyms are taking its place for simplicity, we will still have a look into it.

Initialisms are just what they sound like, created using the initial letters of words and are pronounced as letters, like the FBI.

Acronyms are also formed from initials but sometimes have not one but first two initials of words or more just to maintain its readability. So acronyms are pronounced as words like ISRO.

So Acronyms and Initialisms are more like children of Abbreviations. Now that we are done with definition and things, let’s jump right in to find useful acronyms.

While digging for relevant articles about interest, I realized there isn’t much literature on it. But I found an article written in 1998 by Nirmal Mukhi, an IBM Employee. And it is so down to the point that I had to include it mostly verbatim.

No matter how much time you spend _developing_ your new project, it’ll never become the next killer app without one key ingredient: a great acronym.

\[….\]

It’s become the first phase of software development, whether you follow the Waterfall model, RAD, or Extreme programming.

Classic

The classic acronym is a complete English word or pronounceable set of letters that say something about the technology or process it names when expanded. Recent consensus views such acronym as being downright dull.

Off-the-beaten-path

Such acronyms deviate from the standard view of an acronym -- they are just plain confusing. But their unique nature makes them attention-grabbers. Take .NET, for example. Is it even an acronym? Who knows, but putting punctuation in the acronym is a deft touch, like the first person who decided to wear a baseball cap backward. Besides, the presence of a dot in the acronym lends itself to endless possibilities when you use it within Internet domain names.

Geeky

Acronyms that include scientific notation fall into this category, as does the acronym GNU, which throws in recursion to make things interesting. When you type “ls” to retrieve a file listing, “GNU is Not Unix” is a cool acronym.

Hoodwink them

Acronyms of this type aren’t acronyms at all. They are just smart words positioned to make you think they’re acronyms, thereby enhancing the coolness factor while taking the minimum effort to dream up.

\[…\]

The fruits of our research have yielded a prescription for creating your acronyms:

*   Start top-down (with the acronym) rather than bottom-up (with the words you are trying to capture). Remember, people will see and remember the acronym far more than the words themselves. After some time, nobody cares about the expansion at all. If you do well, the acronym itself will become a word -- quick, do you know the expansions of RADAR or LASER?
*   Sometimes, try as you might, you can’t get a pronounceable word. If this happens, accept it. There’s nothing uglier than forcing pronouncing an unpronounceable acronym (pedantically speaking, all acronyms must be pronounceable, but let’s not call the [word police](http://www.theatlantic.com/unbound/wordpolice/)).

*   The Web Services Description Language (WSDL) is a good example. My stomach churns whenever people call it Wiz-Dill or Wuz-dill or make other feeble attempts at pronouncing it. In such cases, just say the letters, please.
*   If you have an unpronounceable acronym, don’t use ugly letters like “W.” WWW (for the “World-Wide Web,” immortalized in Internet domain names) just rolls off your tongue, doesn’t it? That acronym also demonstrates the drawbacks of the bottom-up approach.
*   Don’t say too much. Brevity is one of the essential features of the acronym. Remember that a lousy acronym mars your technology, idea, or product forever, and long acronyms are always wrong.

*   There’s a new Web services specification, BPEL4WS (Business Process Execution Language for Web Services), whose potential success is seriously challenged by the lack of creativity of its writers.

If you want, you can take a look at the article - \[lol:> The science of acronym development \]([https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/lol/acronym.html](https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/lol/acronym.html)).

While using acronyms, there are some pitfalls, like whether we should use periods in between words. Different style guides like Chicago, APA, and AP recommend different things, but I have come to understand that just don’t use them, only write it in Caps and you are golden.

Above all, make sure you handle the same acronym the same way throughout. Also, make sure that the same acronym isn’t defined in more than one way.

Spell out the acronym on the first reference, and include the abbreviation in parentheses after it. For example, the General Services Administration (GSA). Second and subsequent references can use only the abbreviated form. But if it is more transparent, feel free to use a shortened phrase on the second reference, rather than an acronym.

With great powers of writing acronyms, comes responsibility. That does not make the reader confused by using a lot of those acronyms. Just because you can abbreviate something doesn’t mean you should.

If in doubt, give the reader more clarity, not less.

After scouring the internet for a few more hours, I found a few more tips on creating useful acronyms.

1.  The best acronyms spell out a word related to their cause, function or meaning, or one that elicits positive feelings or associations.
    – [LEAD](http://www.wharton.upenn.edu/academics/LEAD.cfm): for a leadership program, i.e., Leadership Education and Development
    – [LEAP](https://www.mededportal.org/publication/9073): for an educational training module, Learning from your Experiences As a Professional
    – [SAGE](http://www.utsouthwestern.edu/education/medical-school/departments/internal-medicine/divisions/geriatrics/sage.html): A program in which students at UT Southwestern learn about aging, i.e., Southwestern Aging Geriatrics Education program
2.  Even when the letters don’t spell out a word with meaning related to the subject, it helps if what is spelled out feels like a word:
    – LASER: Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation
    – RADAR: RAdio Detecting And Ranging
    – AWOL: Absent With Out Leave
    – SCUBA: Self-Contained Underwater Breathing Apparatus
3.  Whether you have a good acronym or one that is obtuse and not well known, define it early and often so people can easily and quickly figure it out.

Publishers have long acknowledged the challenges of acronyms. Generally, their rules are:
– only the most well-known acronyms can be left as such: AIDS, US, UK
– spell out all other acronyms, at least the first time they appear in the article

Even if all these rules don’t work out for you somehow and you end up something that is not quite making as acronyms, just hope that eventually the concept, organization, and acronym will be so well known and widely used that people won’t even realize that it doesn’t make sense.

Best way to witness growth is to do what you can't do.

Above line is what I learned today, and it is mind blowing, I mean everybody knows it inside, but never acknowledge it because it causes them to feel uncomfortable or forces them to come out of their comfort zones.

Here are list of things that I can't do or don't know how to do it.
	- get fit (really!!!!)
	- get slim (yup both are totally different things)
	- start to blog daily (yes writing a blog post once in a blue moon is cool, but doing it daily is awfully difficult)
	- study DSA for getting a good high paying job
	- and more
	
I am hoping that coming month or year, I might knock off some of things mentioned above. I hope I do.

Write me about things that you can't do or people say you can't do. And what you plan on doing about it.

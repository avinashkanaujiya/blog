# Review

*   There was a kid working on a north shore or coast of a island, he feel like an outsider, even know it.
*   His mother lived on the west coast.
*   Others treat him like an outsider, cuz he has black hair like crows which he gets from his mother. Others were true saxons with broad chest and blonde hairs. His mother is a slave bought by his father, but his father is a good person he treated her fairly.
    *   other womens didnt like her mother.
    *   he worships the old gods, not the white christ, he is of the old tribe.
    *   his father didnt like his black hair and weedy appearance
*   The tribe has a chief named rald, who has a son named raldson.
*   Tadgh, Saelac and Rald were his worst tormentors.
*   He would work all he can to stay safe from his tormentors.
*   One day vikings came and attacked his tribes, killed all men, except chief rald, took kids and their mother.
*   He and his mother were one of them. Vikings killed scald and raldson trying to go overboard.
*   The leader of vikings was harald the one eye. They were going towards east coast direction, maybe to sell them to other people.
*   On east coast they attack another place, maybe kings palace or something, and they take two girls as slaves, princesses.
*   Kids mother is 2nd time slave now.
*   They are thralls of the Harald now, and they will be sold to other people by them.
*   They are all at manau now, after being exiled from Ulfberg by treachorous harald one eye.
*   At the end
*   Dragon Hearts family was destroyed, and killed by tadgh who fled to stavangers.
*   His mother was killed and rest kidnapped by tadghs men.
*   Now they vow to avenge his mother and family.

It starts with a guy talking about his nightmare and how he has tried all kinds of drugs to get rid of it, but could'nt. He talks about how he got to this point. He has a friend named lude, who lives in a building where a oldman named zampano stayed and owns a salon. Building has a manager named Flaze, he is a samaon. He talks about how he regrets answering the phone call from his friend, lude, that fateful night, to come to his building as he had found some interesting things at oldman's place. And talks about what had happened that night. What they found at old man's place. FYI, old man was dead like a month ago. They give away the oldman's things to charity, since he had no relatives and family. The guy takes some papers in which oldman had written some things. And guy reads it whenever he got the time to do it.

But then he starts to get paranoid, stops going anywhere. Time passes for him, without even realizing it. After reading those papers he found out that oldman was talking about some Documentary which never existed in the firstplace. Then he talks about some philosophical things, where it starts to get a bit boring.

Book is a little bit slow in pace for now. Who knows, it might pick up the pace. But it is a horror book for sure. Lets how it goes. I have read about 5% of the book.

title: Dashlane to Bitwarden, why password managers are important and when
publish: false

A while ago I wrote about moving away from google passwords to dashlane, this time it is about moving away from dashlane to [bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/), and hopefully for good this time around.

You guys must be thinking how i keep jumping from one password manager to another, why can't I makeup my mind?

The answer is simple, people change as they grow and so do their opinion, same thing happened with me. Over the course of time, I realised that using a password manager require trust among both user and provider. and do I trust a private mysterious company with my credentials? a big NO.

What instils more trust than a open source software which is developed openly under the sun, which anyone can audit and verify versus the private company.

In bitwarden, we get the trust & security of open source community, where community itself is the user and the provider of the software.

And some people even come out and say that using password manager is a security threat in itself. And I am embarrassed to admit that I get tongue tied at those moments, because it is so obvious to use password managers for me.

But let's see what people actually say about it.


<ul class="bullets">
  <li> software has vulnerabilities, can be hacked </li>
  <li> biometric fingerprints security lock can be override with only fingers of a person who is sleeping, hence easier to access the password manager by third party</li>
  <li> it creates a single point of failure</li>
</ul>
People who say that software can be hacked, forget that the whole banking system is built on software itself. Everything they do online is built on software.

So software who's job is to keep passwords safe is obviously going to a better job than other software.

But still above mentioned points cannot be used to say that password managers are infallible. They can be misused, but they are far better than using simpler and easier passwords. And all the hack that occurs are not because of software was vulnerable, most of the it happens due to carefully crafted social engineering.

Password Managers are safe to use if and only if following things are taken care of
- Password Managers password is itself complicated and you can remember it well.
- Do not use bio-metric passwords like fingerprints to lock your password manager.
- keep changing the PIN or password often
- keep the reset code safe & someplace secure
- use 2FA authentications wherever possible like TOTP

After all this talk, we should also understand that there are different kinds of threat a person face, on personal level, professional level, as internet citizen, as bank user, as a social media user and etc. 

So use of password manager also changes according to threat scenario or level.

And also we should consider some more factor while using the password manager or other such tools. 
- Like how often we will be accessing that site or thing. If it is too often, on a daily basis, it probably is less important than a bank password and we can keep them in password manager.
- If it is rarely accessed, then we can formulate a algorithm - a manual algorithm, for reconstructing a password on the fly, whenever you need them.

So as frequency of use decreases we can reduce the password managers use and increase the manual password handling, but manual password handling does not means to write password somewhere, just keep the algorithm handy.
